Q1. 

-- I have created this from my local machine instead of a VM in GCP as I intend to continue using this machine instead of the VM. However, after going through the video for the VM setup, I noticed that we deploy exactly the same resources so the output should still be valid

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with
the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # google_bigquery_dataset.dataset will be created
