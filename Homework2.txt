Q1. Check Q1etl_web_to_gcs_green.py file. Answer was taken from the print inside the transform function where we print the length of the dataframe, giving us the total rows.

Q2. 

	prefect deployment build ./etl_web_to_gcs.py:etl_web_to_gcs -n "2021 web to gcs yellow data flow"
	prefect deployment apply etl_web_to_gcs-deployment.yaml


Q3. Check Q2_web_to_gcs_2019_yellow.py and Q2ET_to_bq_2019_yellow.py (apologies for the wrong Q number in the file, that's a typo). web_to_gcs file was used to load the parquet files into the google storage acccount and the ET_to_bq was used with sub_flows to create a deployment with the multiple files for the 2019 year.

For the prefect deployment:

	cmd: prefect deployment build ./Q2_web_to_gcs_2019_yellow.py:et_yellow_2019_parent_flow -n "2019 Yellow Parametrized Flow"
	cmd: prefect deployment apply et_yellow_2019_parent_flow-deployment.yaml

The row count was added in the write_bq task on the Q2ET... file

Q4. Change the code and upload the flow file to the github workspace (file named: Q4etl_web_to_gcs_github.py). Then create the Github Block through the Prefect UI (using Orion locally) and pass that block name in the initial cmd command:

	prefect deployment build Q4etl_web_to_gcs_github.py:github_flow_green -n "GitHub Storage Flow" -sb github/zoom-git -n "Github Flow"

Modify the yaml file to include the parameters, then run in cmd
	
	prefect deployment apply github_flow_green-deployment.yaml

Start agent

	prefect agent start --work-queue "default"

Run flow from UI

Q5. Modified original file and created Q5etl_notification.py to take the data. Created account in app.prefect.cloud and, in conda environment:

	prefect cloud login
	prefect deployment build ./Q5etl_notification.py:notification_flow_green -n "Notification Flow"

Filled the yaml file with the correct parameters for the correct data.

	prefect deployment apply notification_flow_green-deployment.yaml
	prefect agent start --work-queue "default"

Created the necessary blocks (GCS storage and GCS credentials) and ran the flow from the UI of prefect cloud

Q6. In prefect cloud (or local orion), go to the Blocks blade, search for "Secret", create a new secret with 10 characters. When the code block shows up, underneath you have the masked value and see 8 asterisks
